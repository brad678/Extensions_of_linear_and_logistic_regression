# Extensions_of_linear_and_logistic_regression

Discussed Several methods for extension of linear regression (by replacing least squares with alternative fitting procedures that can yield better prediction accuracy and model interpretability) such as:
Ridge regression, Lasso, Best subset selection, Forward stepwise selection and Backward stepwise selection

Discussed alternative method for logistic regression that works well on multi class problems such as:
Linear discriminant analysis(LDA) and Quadratic discriminant analysis(QDA)

Discussed models by moving beyond linearity(in above methods such as ridge etc we are still using the linear model, here we try to model by relaxing the linear assumption) such as:
Local regression(loess) and Generalized additive models(GAM)
